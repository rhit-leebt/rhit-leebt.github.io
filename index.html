                My name is Braxton Lee, and I am a sophmore Conputer Science major at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
                in Terre Haute, IN. My hometown is Honolulu, HI, where I went to `Iolani School.
                The goal of this website is to teach you a little more about myself, my projects, and my hobbies.
            <p>
                When I'm not doing schoolwork, by farovite things to do are to either get outside and enjoy nature through hiking or
                spending time at the ocean, or by making my own small programming projects. Like most other students my age, I also enjoy
                video games, usually of the racing variety.
